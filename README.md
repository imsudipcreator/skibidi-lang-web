## 🚀 About Skibidi-Lang

[**Skibidi-Lang**]("https://github.com/imsudipcreator/skibidi-lang") is an experimental, open-source programming language created for learning compiler design, experimenting with ideas, and having fun while doing it.

It’s powered by LLVM on the inside, but intentionally unserious on the outside.

- Meme-first by design
- Community-driven development
- Built to learn how compilers actually work
- Not production-ready — and not trying to be
